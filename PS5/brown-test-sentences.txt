results
further , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the poynting-robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force .
this effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the earth .

he showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned ) reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed , therefore , that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible .
concluding remarks
one sees that this happens because the null space of af has dimension 1 only .
let p be the minimal polynomial for t , af , where the af , are distinct irreducible monic polynomials over f and the af are positive integers .
then ( a ) af ; ;
( c ) if af is the operator induced on af by t , then the minimal polynomial for af is af .
the projection af will be the identity on af and zero on the other af .
thus there are polynomials af such that af .
since af and p divides af for af , we have af .
we wish to show that the range of af is exactly the subspace af .
but then it is immediate that af , i.e. , that **ya is in the range of af .
it is certainly clear that the subspaces af are invariant under t .
this shows that the minimal polynomial for af divides af .
then af .
it is easily seen that af divides g .
let us put af .
the reader should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that af and in general that af .
we say that n is nilpotent if there is some positive integer r such that af .
now suppose that we also have af where d' is diagonalizable , n' is nilpotent , and af .
for , using the fact that n and n' commute af and so when r is sufficiently large every term in this expression for af will be 0 .
from these results , one sees that the study of linear operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators .
then af .
we now write af where af are distinct complex numbers .
thus af if and only if af .
since af are linearly independent functions and the exponential function has no zeros , these r functions af , form a basis for the space of solutions .
each die has probability af of producing an ace ; ;
the random variable x takes the values af with probabilities af or , more briefly af .
as s increases we consider the two free corner points of the square , af and af , adjacent to p and q respectively .
each point on c , as a vertex , may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal points by the above construction .
if the vertex is at af , and if the interior of c is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating c clockwise through 90-degrees about the vertex .
we note that two such curves c and af , cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points ; ;
we will refer to the plane of c and af as the c-plane and to the plane of the graph as the aj .
in the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are af .
in the c-plane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian coordinates u , v with the origin at q and such that both c and af have finite slope at q .
now , to find af , one needs the intersection of c and af near q .
therefore , af is single-valued near q .
this set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals .
a tangent point q in the c-plane occurs when c and af are tangent to one another .
there are three possibilities : ( a ) af remains tangent to c as it is translated ; ;
the same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of af .
this is true of all components which have such a bounded support .
we again consider a fixed point p at af and a variable point q at af on c .
these s-values are just the ordinary values of af .
the values af are the ordinary values at af of a multi-valued function g{t} which has components corresponding to those of f{t} .
we first define a function b{t} as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on c and vertex at t , b{t} is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences between t and the backward corner points .
now with p fixed at af , af-values occur when the corner af crosses c , and are among the values of s such that af .
no generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible .
let q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli af and af , and let **zg be a af curve of order k on q .
on these generators let af and af be , respectively , the harmonic conjugates of af and af with respect to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets aj .
in particular , tangents to c are transformed into tangents to c' .
a conic , c , being a ( 1 , 1 ) curve on q , meets the image of any line of af , which we have already found to be a af curve on q , in af points .
from the preceding remarks , it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion .
hence it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective de jonquieres involution of order af and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either af or af .
the second requires that there be a line through p which meets **zg in af points .
now consider an arbitrary line , l , meeting q in two points , af and af .

employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those without , and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training .

on the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire .
somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told , that combat was an intermittent activity .
time to become afraid .
but theirs defied the detectors .
the warped , broken trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes .
lying in the grass behind the brush clump , warren looked about .
the walk and his fears had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch of the night air .
figures seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark ; ;
above , the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds , diluting the valley's dark to a pallid light .
that was the day that pierre had told warren about the abbey of solesmes .
the distant ship isn't there until you get the focus .
mr. christiansen knows that a soldier will get the distinguished service medal for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian .
it wasn't there .
this is why he made such a magnificent soldier .
it just didn't occur to trig that anything serious would happen to him .
beyond were industries and factories .
a knot of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon .
wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $2,500 , but when he mentioned this to the deacons they said nothing .
wilson inquired about it .
behind were privies , for there was no sewage system .
he talked about it to the presiding elder .
and after wilson had talked to mrs. catt and to others , he was absolutely amazed .
payne dismounted in madison place and handed the reins to herold .
no one would question such an errand .
like the bell at mass , the doorbell was pitched too high .
seward would be up there .
it made no sound .
there was a lady there , in a nightdress .
the clammy air revived him .
he rode on and on .
booth had delivered his line .
that absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water .
with a sneer , the man spread his legs and , a third time , confronted them .
for a moment , boy and mount hung in midair .
his head hung over the boards of katie's stall ; ;
however , a boy's lively eyes might rove .
it troubled him that he couldn't always see what papa saw .
stevie flared .
the figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence .
would papa really die ? ?
open your heart to him and pray , stephen , pray ! !
papa was disappointed that none of the brothers had heard the call .
ludie did as he pleased .
ludie hopped rides on freight cars , and was chased by mr. yankton , the railroad guard .
the snow came a little faster now , he noted .
that'll put the place back to normal .
clean the place up .
a tune began to whirl inside his head .
he glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them .
hired , hard lackeys of the warmongering capitalists .
somebody'll hafta start thinkin .
why didn't the damn reactionaries bump him off ? ?
like a particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind .
keep the chatter to a minimum , short answers , one word , if possible .
all those dumb 8-balls croaked .
give um the works .
there was a hell of a noise this time of morning .
for christ's sake ! !
what the hell was he up to now ? ?
brandon dreamed .
rousseau is so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books , too .
he goes to the chief himself .
but then one day , while on a week's visit to the country home of a retired swiss jeweler , rousseau amused the company with a few little melodies he had written , to which he attached no great importance .
`` put a few such songs together '' , they urged him .
no .
but no .
that glory , craved for so long , was now forbidden to him .
all these emotions were screwed up to new heights when , after acceptance and the first rehearsals , there ensued such a buzz of excitement among parisian music lovers that duclos had to come running to rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the king's amusements , and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of fontainebleau .
why had not this success come to him before he had plunged into his discourse , and before he had committed himself to a life of austerity and denial ? ?
i have heard people talk with contempt about the british regulars , but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant .
i would have stood there and died there if left to myself , but cousin simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there ; ;
mattathias dover said :
`` do not listen to that frenchman .
charles had died two weeks before , in early november , without being reconciled to the church .
`` how long , my lord ? ?
monsieur favre's threat would become a reality , for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that frenchman '' .
the firelight played over eli's flowing white locks and rugged features .
`` what was your reply to that '' ? ?
the chinless jake called .
he knew its meaning .
the head was wrapped in a turban and on top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho had been flung .
adam recognized this one .
he demanded out loud .
he had died there .
she charged off to the bedrooms .
`` sleep well '' ? ?
the woman had the glassy look of an invalid , as if she had not slept at all .
the three had little to say to each other .
mcfeeley identified himself .
they assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained .
nothing was said about hotels or train journeys .
he realized that he had no idea where the telephone was .
mme vienot , considerably younger and very different .
one of the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas , which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet .
the concierge called out to them as they were passing through the foyer .
looked at everything .
instead , they went on down the hall to their room .
he felt close to mary , having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey .
her son was dead .
they can have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone '' .
together he and argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets .
he hesitated for a moment when michelangelo asked him to disrobe , so michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes .
`` you're too clean .
he was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil .
you own me .
the red glow from the cove had died out of the sky .
peter , you lummox , you've forgot to order the musicians '' .
on the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers -- smugglers -- lived along the churning great south bay and the narrow barrier of sand , fire island .
the captain's gig of h.m.s. mercury was being rowed to h.m.s. neptune .
he scratched his mosquito-plagued neck .
the moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers .
no doubt john hancock would do well now ; ;
he was proud that he had never worn a wig .
the future would happen ; ;
a man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days .
had he found the meaning too late ? ?
he ground his teeth together .
globocnik built the death's-head corps .
`` his answer '' ? ?
i hated you when i first came in .
i used to love this country and believe that someday we'd win our battle for equality .
it was an answer that styka understood .
flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread .
he washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch .
we moved down broadway from ginmill to ginmill .
he can't object to that '' .
she began to laugh .
`` joseph maria ballestre meet francis xavier bowman .
imagine that .
i never felt such a lowdown hound in my life .
i couldn't face thelma after that night .
i wrote her that i'd met up with eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express .
she added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking .
poor devil he can't have been too happy either .
`` whom god hath joined '' etcetera .
when we separated that evening pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into eileen's hand to help towards a layette .
he would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed .
we can return the following morning
the casual seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison .
`` how can you say such a thing ? ?
the officer had told him that both lists must be checked .
he had acknowledged the man .
the flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current .
the thin gray figures raised a hoarse , cawing cry like the call of a bird flock .
no one moved to them .
one man dropped to his knee for better aim .
watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet .
the man's voice was a sweet , patient whisper .
we're almost there .
watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches .
no , nor later .
his name had been crossed off a list .
now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering .
leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginnings .
mrs. trempler was tuberculosis , mrs. surcliffe was mothers' march of dimes , mrs. craven was cancer , and mrs. gilkson did the kidney .
he was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the blevins' , thinking that they might give him a drink .
he thought first of his son and daughter , away at college .
it was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known .
she would have said triumph .
but the boy the boy had been alive yesterday .
i shook him a little harder and made some noise .
he always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him .
he was like a mean horse to come at from the rear .
pa pulled at the covers .
`` no , pa .
that cock .
they curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .
`` what'd he say ? ?
pa's scared to hell of axes '' .
that cock .
not any more .
`` come on , jorge '' .
put your arms around him '' .
`` shut up .
so the pattern was established .
the evaporative cooler had been moved to granny's room , and her door was kept shut ; ;
driving along the caliche-topped road to town , howard talked .
it made her feel different about howard .
that night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting on a moonlight night .
he had found his fowl .
`` vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ? ?
next , the hen was nested and all seemed well .
winston stacked miss ada's thin pink dishes in the sink .
`` to be left behind '' was printed at the top in miss ada ; ;
`` four years '' ! !
winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car ; ;
that house was ten years off his life let himself .
the tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing .
she had talked to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which made him sweat and feel ashamed .
in a week the hyacinths would spike out .
halfway across the house , he could have smelled her morning perfume .
leave that fool picture out '' , she added sharply .
he had only agreed with miss ada about getting the valet , but he had actually suggested the photograph to mr. jack .
i'm going to put it on my dresser '' .
for many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep .
heavy-coated , severe-looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic .
`` i read those newspaper stories about you '' , she had said .
`` why do you say that '' ? ?
`` my aunt raised me .
we've always been so close '' .
i can say this : i'm dead serious about going back to school .
`` do you like to dance ? ?
i knew that .
it seemed to me that i was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well .
i laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round .
i walked over to him .
`` okay '' , i said to the attendant , `` i'll let you know if i close the deal on the office in this building '' .
you're the one i was talking to about a monthly rental .
you don't want to lease a place way out in the sticks .
i was held up a bit trying to make a left turn .
traffic was pretty heavy .
after fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left .
in a flash she was away to the back , paying no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats .
got it '' ? ?
kinda like a zombie ? ?
his mouth worked over the profanity , the obscenities in his vocabulary .
`` you get that kid over to rose's house '' .
he ran a finger down his cheek , tracing the scratch there .
vince shouted finally , `` get her over to rose's and i'll come by and see that she stays put '' .
her teeth chattered so that she made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible .
his small , mean eyes regarded marty steadily , unblinkingly .
the ford and the pickup truck sped west toward sanford's run .
there were other farmhouses nearby .
telephone poles lined the road .
marty faced east and started walking down the left side of the road .
the viscous mud was ankle-deep , and in places great puddles spread across the road and reflected the murky light .
for just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help .
marty's heart skipped a beat when he recognized it .
a second car was coming from the west , from the direction of sanford's run .
he lurched on down the road despairingly , because there was no place else to go .
it was his only sanctuary .
he forced himself to stay frozen there .
`` get in '' , charley estes said brusquely .
every man in every one of these houses is a night rider .
shayne looked at his watch .
rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung up .
the bartender brought rourke's drink and shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar .
shayne locked his big hands around harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway .
`` come on '' , he said .
he advanced slowly , directly , giving no hint of a feint to either side .
mickey backed off two steps , forcing him to come on again .
roberts was a wastrel .
he found the key to the jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes .
it would be a bad place to die .
it was too late to worry about that .
he made his way back to the jeep .
he went back once more to the jeep and started the short drive to the hotel .
on the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over lake pontchartrain and along the coast .
`` that's an idea .
`` now how in hell would i remember that '' ? ?
she asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye .
in a tour around the stacks , he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed clockwise around the room .
no mention of new orleans .
`` who's there '' ? ?
i go over to castro and get fixed up there .
sure .
fifty a throw , that the deal ? ?
this kind of place
surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle ? ?

`` not that there's much use in locking up the smokehouse and the storehouse now .
it was not very reasonable to believe that lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come back to honotassa with a formed plan to murder her .
she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life .
`` too much work this morning , miss sarah -- everybody gone like that '' --
she come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you '' .
`` not much breakfast this morning .
george had a tack hammer .
rev said , `` come in , sarah .
`` no .
as she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself ; ;
no matter what had happened or hadn't happened , somebody had to see about dinner .
he looked at his watch .
the doorman began to nod his head automatically , then remembered who gilborn was , what had happened to him the night before .
the morning he walked in to announce to her , blushing , that he was married .
after that day , blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened .
`` for the future .
come right along .
`` that important '' ? ?
`` that important '' .
`` no .
questions about the show tonight '' .
`` some better .
raymond fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed `` cradle song '' in case it was needed .
he instructed shirl winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board .
the crime showed too much planning , the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist .
`` no .
there's a couple of call-backs i can work on '' .
`` bunch of damn jerks '' , hub growled .
vecchio shouldered in .
he clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room .
the place had the air of a morgue .
her motives were too blatant .
he hadn't touched her .
too monstrous , of course .
she was married to him for better or for worse .
he went to the front door and opened it and looked in .
`` no .
must have cost plenty .
he had left after the scuffle ; ;
jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong ? ?
she had left the party early , pleading a headache .

a couple of sobs escaped him , followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state .
`` not about me ? ?
`` no use , he won't come '' .
griffith raised placating hands .
he finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing .
one more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be leading him away .
i'd like to talk to him '' .
hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building .
the single shot would come ; ;
the legation was generously set back from the building line ; ;
would the shot come from a roof ? ?
he went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule .
he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch .
gun set the captain's fifth of hiram walker inside the safe before he reported to lt. killpath , though he knew that killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on herman wolff's gift .
killpath pulled one thin leg up , clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut .
the 7:45 bell rang and he could hear the outside doors bang shut , closing in the assembled day watch .
`` no , sir '' .
`` no , sir '' .
gun knew that nothing but aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time .
`` no , sir '' .
what have you to say to that , sergeant '' ? ?
an argument with orville torrence killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range .
not that he gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about killpath's little speech on the comportment of platoon commanders .
mr. phillips took a razor to gonzalez , prop. , but left the promise that spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that spanish clientele would be welcome .
`` she's honest as the day '' , mr. phillips said , and added , `` mr. gunnar , i can say this to you : beebe is a little too honest .
`` come on , darling .
for he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself .
when he heard calenda say : `` what about that picture you took this afternoon '' ? ?
he dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up .
so he made a mistake .
he considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too .
the police car had pulled up behind a small sedan , its headlights still on .
there should be an excited conversation , for somewhere , directly below them , was a treasure lost for more than four hundred years .
no one had screamed .

two to three weeks prior to the charter of the virginia , graham had been snooping around the san luis rey mission .
that was a hell of a note , he thought .
turning on the hi-fi , he went back to the cockpit , stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music .
his feet still hung over the stern of the transom , but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in .

the landlord had died .
haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor , as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks .
once inside his apartment , he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair .
`` that bitch would love a divorce '' , he growled .
there was no hurry .
we took the matches -- they were book matches and once they'd been touched might retain fingerprints -- and the change .
the candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the crate when it guttered out .
we planned ahead only one step , a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes .

that afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house , his hopes had been high .
he had an uneasy feeling about it .
he finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him .
the place was quiet .
drifting here and there .
he made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf .
the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air .
i could not cling to my past nor did i wish to .
as i had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application .
i stopped by the counter .
he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar .
i had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times .
why had i registered ? ?
he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ;

they followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear .
they crowded him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in .

so long as sally's pa was coming out best on the haggle , dan didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits' worth .
from the way the wound in his head was itching , dan knew that it would heal .
the wound in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals .
already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains .
it was the barkeep .
he did not reply , going on toward the back .
in town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; ;
clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm .
the long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless .
although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity .
the low clouds made bombing difficult .
greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home .
he narrowed the shape down to two : either a zero or a u. s. navy type aircraft .
japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , american on speed and firepower .
belton , the one on the right .
`` greg to sweeney blue .
no turns .
he tightened his turn .
he pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back .
autos whizzed past .
the voice was that of johnson , tail gunner off another crew .
i said that it didn't make any difference to me either , as far as i knew .
johnson never would have believed she had a son that age .
get in '' .
too high .
`` aye-yah-ah-ah '' ! !
i guided her to the divan , turned off the tv , faced her .
would you like a drink , or coffee '' ? ?
about the murder '' .
she went on :
there's a walk there that goes out to quebec drive .
so you'll have everything all to yourself , doggone ''
i spun about and clattered through the front room to the door .
`` how'd you hear about this one '' ? ?
he filled me in .
it's a secret .
that she impressed me instantly was obvious ; ;
there was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour .
`` don't worry about me .
`` would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself '' ? ?
she repeated `` eurydice '' .
`` hoa-whup '' ! !
she had hated the whole idea before they started .
she had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder .
to his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze .
walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods .
he sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters .
he made a sound of despair deep in his throat .
i noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair .
you are welcome to eromonga .
some had been there for years ; ;
the man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul .
maybe to beat up on his squaw '' .
he said to his partner .
it made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .
benson said to ramey .
them's brains '' .
the command post was underground , and well camouflaged .
but to keith's london-bred mind , such acreage sounded rather invincible .
the great black leopards .
so you turn around '' .
went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .
`` he's one hell of a decent boy .
`` no '' ? ?
all tourists come to florida .
`` he has the distributorship for florida , you say '' ? ?
he pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .
his superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .
he had no rice .
he wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .
matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .
the cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .
some odor made him lean over the man .
matsuo called .
his superiors had said that all marines were depraved .
`` seems to me i don't remember altering any law about that '' .
the stranger ignored him .
the law-abiding citizens of petrie had gathered inside kaster's store , halfway down the street .
billy tilghman did just that .
led by bill doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .
the two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .
`` just dropped in to ask where jed hawkins lives .
leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to neal brown .
then he slowed to a walk .
come inside now '' .
the drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the louisiana slave compounds .
come a bit closer .
she said with intense feeling : `` come near , let me feel your arms .
satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced delphine that dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver .
one less shouldn't matter to him '' .
had dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the lalauries' tender care if he valued his life .
besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .
you did this you like to hurt to beat people i want to go home '' .
`` bastards '' , he would say , `` all i did was put a beat to that vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me '' ! !
ever since all that .
the freight car was cold , early in the morning .
so we ran away '' .
now that you offer '' .
`` no , no .
`` henh '' ! !
but if the old man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig .
the women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; ;
this place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness .
it slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches .
above it , from a second-story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood .
he would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .
she was so heavy that maggie's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her .
`` you can joke ! !
she was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable .
i was so cruel to tolley , so unfair .
surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .
and what had happened ? ?
never , `` quit that , you sor'l devil '' ! !
tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested .
handsomest colt in all kentucky .
there was an idea .
`` don't you dare ! !
doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .
if adelia had felt about someone as henrietta felt about charles , would she have run away with him ? ?
a curious thought to end a curious night .
`` you'd like to hear how i go about it '' .
`` come on , do .
`` to the graveyard .
she had been sent to the wrong place for duty .
how , he wondered , does one enjoy one's spare time ? ?
`` i went over to the willows and dropped two notes '' .
what would happen next ? ?
why go on ? ?
he sat down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes .
a dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's place .
he had no great prejudice against shills ; ;
`` very well '' .
`` have him come in '' .
mckinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into spencer's possession and that '' --
a glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away .
three days had passed since spencer's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears .
to have the greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed .
it came to him as he wept there aboard the somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven .
one white hand poised a stick above his desk .
they chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick .
in the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap .
they singsonged the portion at the teacher , who accompanied them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick .
he came with his son .
he complained to me once that i must talk to her .
you could wish that .
mrs. monmouth thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting .
in the course of our talk , askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying .
burns and i had not loved each other .
`` osric pendleton '' ? ?
you know that '' .
`` no , thank you .
had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind ? ?
i made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .
in the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on .
then the telephoning began .
sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff .
that at last the vigilance , the will gives way ? ?
at the time i was filled with self-pity at this separation , but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that outcry .
i added .
something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing .
she might like to take him to st. peter's .
`` come on , you'll be late '' .
for a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar .
it was said that he had had a vision .
`` go back to your lodges '' ! !
a plane up in the sky , above the clouds , and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away .
julia moved past .
i won't be long '' .
he could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages .
to the manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this ; ;
don't work too hard '' .
i might struggle in for a jury .
lucy had an idea that myra loved it .
she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had .
the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels .
she said to herself , abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds .
she wondered , with a baffled feeling of helplessness .
son .
he says you're limping more than you need to '' .
i can't go in .
`` i can speak both kinds of latin , smart aleck '' .
she seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace .
`` a cane's mighty handy .
i come early in the morning '' .
it made her blister .
( `` what did one tonsil say to the other tonsil ? ?
but it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head .
everybody knew that john cooper had married edythe on the rebound .
edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example .
after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company .
she was almost sick when bobbie came home with the news that poor john had won the job .
i dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened .
`` stop that ! !
something so incredible --
`` by fall they'll be back in school '' , i'd say , trying to sound encouraging .
i had a feeling that young pete michelson , the most promising intern at fairview , had something to do with it , too .
`` have you spoken to a doctor about it '' ? ?
`` i sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said .
`` no '' .
`` no '' .
`` here and there .
once before i had been to paris , long before i married valery .
i never got there .
so i drank more cognac .
a good binge has that kind of therapeutic value .
there wasn't much light in the blue dark , but i could see her well .
not good looking , but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive .
we went to the louvre for a few hours , then by metro to a cabaret in montmartre .
she had heard about it the night before at her hotel .
the only boy , the family darling .
`` drop a cold key down his back '' .
at last , alarm .
she arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other .
`` oh put it there '' ! !
i never heard my folks talk about her , though .
and so i was really upset the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing mrs. warren .
the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too .
infinite peace , complete contentment .
and i had no doubts about how true this love was .
`` love me '' ? ?
love you '' .
so i went to boston .
`` need a pumpkin to get to the party '' ? ?
come along with me '' .
`` aw , come on '' .
the doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi ; ;
charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , peony being less than weatherproof .
next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .
said this note .
just look at that sky .
by the next morning , she had turned the paper over .
he didn't know what was so tough about vivian's world , slopping around nassau with what's-his-name .
phil rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay .
mike yelled to the catcher .
in the last of the sixth inning mike deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder's head .
`` you trying to say i started the fight '' ? ?
`` is this because of what happened out there '' ? ?
phil started to say something but eddie cut him short .
or your fielding average .
she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested .
`` i've heard about it '' , samuel burns said .
it was no use .
i drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ;
hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago .
gone back for reunions .
he didn't have to be told his son looked like him .
height , 6' .
how do you tell a college like hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself ? ?
he finished with a flurry of good wishes to hanford college and signed the letter .
when i went to college they begged you to come .
my john applied to six colleges before he got in '' .
`` no .
cady , deep in thought , neither heard nor answered .
dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys .
no , cady , he made second team .
he keeps the beat going .
remember what you used to say in the army ? ?
in the morning the shorts were where he had left them .
it was almost too easy .
a glissade of giggles slid over their voices .
he considered the sober possibility .
there was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean .
he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened , which was as honest as he could put it .
of course , the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts .
but not any more .
how did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ?
heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him .
i think adam herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side .
i've caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to resent me .
allied to them was gerry , devoting much time to swaying her father , and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william was unwilling to interfere further .
sure , ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the big three .
mr. willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum .
`` i know what i'm talking about in that department '' .
they headed in that direction and , at san juan capistrano by-the-sea came upon barco sitting in the quaint old spanish mission drive-in , eating a hot tamale .
so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly :
his manhood had been attacked .
he directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near santa monica .
with quibs and gibes , the policemen again started digging .
said the digger .
i knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when viola was called to the stand .
no .
what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink .
no , not bermuda .
bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes .
i had once been a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness , `` oh , my souffle has collapsed '' .
in deference to country-squirehood .
in my estimation , they were people who read daphne du maurier , and discussed kafka ; ;
jennie had shouted each time .
needless to say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period .
i tried my hardest , with little help , may i say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe .
these are but a sampling of the insults i endured .
he made many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general .
but it was small consolation .
he looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch .
it all seemed rather hopeless .
i guess you know about that .
now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it '' ? ?
many shapes in bathtubs .
there are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations .
she said to the saleslady , `` i want a dress to put on around the house '' .
no less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergyman's sermon .
it-wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as well as wit .
`` i am told that in america you have non-books by non-writers , brought out by non-publishers for non-readers .
`` but you must have heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent years of james and the antic heyday of coward .
`` oh , i forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance .
and they had told their mother about the tumbles .
and so they were consistently true to their principles .
asked one of the children .
he was the funniest man .
that tap had a slight bangish quality .
and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing .
later on , the children told her further about somersaulting .
she added .
possibly , the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration .
and the other went on to development of the idea .
the albany civic opera's presentation of spumoni's immortal il sevigli del spegititgninino , with guest contralto hattie sforzt .
the night he saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo , complaining -- in ad-lib -- that `` it smelled '' .
you have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them .
nuf sed .
oddly enough , this is an amulet against housebreakers , presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949 .
